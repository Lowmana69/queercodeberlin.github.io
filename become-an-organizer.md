Queer Code is very much a team effort. You're very welcome to host and run your own event under the Queer Code, but for it to be successful it's best you get other organizers involved, even if it's just to help you shape your event ideas.

# How to write a great event

Follow these guidelines when you're drafting you're event. People reviewing your draft will use this to assess the event, so making sure you've considered everything otherwise it's like you'll have to revise the draft.

### Time
 * At least 2 weeks prior to the time you'll publish the event. We'd suggest 3 weeks to give us all time to work on the draft.
 * Check for other date clashes in the Meetup calendar.

### Image
 * If you don't have an image of your own, use Unsplash to find an accurate image. If you're struggling, ask an organizer to help.

### RSVPs
 * If the event is more than a month in the future, don't open RSVPs until exactly one month before the event.
 * Make sure you cap the number of attendees. You'll need to know how many attendees your venue can hold.
 * No-shows can be a real problem. Rather than artificially increasing the capacity, we rely on sending a reminder email 2 days before to keep the number of no-shows low. So please make sure the number you use here accuretely reflects the capacity of the venue.

###Â Where
 * If you're meeting in a private space, make sure you give detailed instructions about how to enter the building.
 * If you're meeting in a public space, it would help for you to have an easy way that people that can identify you. Recognising you is not enough: try a rug or a rainbow flag instead, and make sure you mention this in the Meetup event.
